# Weather-Dashboard-App


## Description
The is a weather dashboard web application that presents users with the current and future (5 day forecast) weather conditions of the city they have searched for. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It also utlises BootStrap, dayJS for date formatting and third party API from https://openweathermap.org for weather condition data.


## Programming

I used HTML, CSS, BootStrap, DayJS, Open Weather API and JQuery to create a weather Dashboard app that:

1) Displays current and future weather conditions for the city the user inputs on the input field and saves it to search history displayed on the browser
2) Presents the below when the user views the current weather conditions for that city:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed

3) Presents a 5-day forecast that displays the following when the user views future weather conditions for that city:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
4) Presents current and future conditions when a user click on a city in the search history
